Rick has made a new machine that translates text to speech and now needs it to spout off his catch phrases.
He's told you to make a program that counts from 0 to 20 and prints out the following words:
Whenever the number is evenly divisible by 2 print "Wub"
Whenever the number is evenly divisible by 3 print "Lubba"
Whenever the number is evenly divisible by 5 "Dub-Dub"
Each word should have spaces on both sides.
Everything that prints out should end with a "!"
For example:
When the number is 6, the program should print "WubLubba!"
When the number is 15, the program should print "LubbaDub-Dub!"
When the number is 20, the program should print "Wub Dub-Dub!"

This is designed to require some research and there are many ways to solve it, there is no single correct solution
