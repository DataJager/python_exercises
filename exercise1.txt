Rick has made a new machine that translates text to speech and now needs it to spout off his catch phrases.
He's told you to make a program that counts from 0 to 20 and prints out the following words:
Whenever the number is evenly divisible by 2 print "Wub"
Whenever the number is evenly divisible by 3 print "Lubba"
Whenever the number is evenly divisible by 5 "Dub-Dub"
Every line that prints out should end with a "!"
If none of these conditions are met, print a blank line.

For example:
When the number is 6, the program should print "WubLubba!"
When the number is 15, the program should print "LubbaDub-Dub!"
When the number is 20, the program should print "Wub Dub-Dub!"
When the number is 7, print a blank line.

Hints are contained in exercise1_hint#.txt
Hints get progressively more revealing so start with the first and see how many you need

This is designed to require some research and there are many ways to solve it, there is no single correct solution

Extra Credit:
Make all output appear on one line
Store each output in an array or list, with one output per line
Store each output in a dictionary with the input as the key and the output as the value
